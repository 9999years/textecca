# About Textecca

## Inspirations

The internal representation of rendered documents is based on [Pandoc][Text.Pandoc.Definition].

The semantic nature and multiple backengs of [reST/Sphinx][reST] are good.

I admire the versatility of LaTeX and the many DSLs people have managed to create in it over the years.
